# Bad things
1. oh.my.zsh
  1.
1. presto
  1. maybe i should be using this instead of oh.my.zsh
1.  Powerline isn't easy to install.
1.  Had some problems getting my godot tools to run.  Had to use `eval` where I didn't used to.  I think it makes a little more sense this way but it took awhile to get through.
